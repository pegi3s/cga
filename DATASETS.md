# Test data

Download and uncompress the ZIP file, and move the directory named `cga-test-data`, where you will find: (1) the test data (`input.fasta` and `ref.fasta`) and the pipeline configuration file (`cga.params`) and (2) a file called `run.sh`, that contains the commands to test the pipeline. Simply edit the `cga.params` file to set the `host_working_dir` to point to the `cga-test-data` and execute the `run.sh` file.
